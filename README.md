# Real-Time-Face-Detection
"Cascade Classifier" is used to detect different features of face. Keras is used with Tensorflow as backend  "Vgg-Face model weights"  are used  Which is deeper than Facebooks Deep Face it has 22 layers and 37 deep units.   
This is a one shot learning process. It requires only one image of a person which is stored in different folder and name which is given to the stored image is returned while recognizing a person.  
"Cosine similarity"  is calculated between the stored image and currently predicted result if it is low then we can say that it is the same person Otherwise it returns unknown.
